# Flappy-AI

An AI that plays flappy bird Using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) python module which allows to create neural networks.

The python language and the neat module were used to create the functionalities of the game and train the A.I. to play flappy bird and score the most points based on the best generation and fitness level (nodes of the neural network).
